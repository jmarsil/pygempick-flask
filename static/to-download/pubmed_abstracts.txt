1) Spontaneous CSF leak is a challenging condition, with frequent recurrences following attempted surgical closure. The selection of graft materials depends on the experience of the operating surgeon. Leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF) is a second-generation platelet concentrate that has currently invaded every surgical specialty. To our knowledge, no previous reports about the use of L-PRF in repair of CSF leak were published. The study was conducted to assess the potential role of L-PRF in spontaneous CSF leaks repair.
2) Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a hematopoietic growth factor that can stimulate a variety of cells, but its overexpression leads to excessive production and activation of granulocytes and macrophages with many pathogenic effects. This cytokine is a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases, and several anti-GM-CSF antibodies have advanced to Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with such diseases, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis. GM-CSF is also an essential factor in preventing pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), a disease associated with GM-CSF malfunction arising most typically through the presence of GM-CSF neutralizing auto-antibodies. Understanding the mechanism of action for neutralizing antibodies that target GM-CSF is important for improving their specificity and affinity as therapeutics and, conversely, in devising strategies to reduce the effects of GM-CSF auto-antibodies in PAP. We have solved the crystal structures of human GM-CSF bound to antigen-binding fragments of two neutralizing antibodies, the human autoantibody F1 and the mouse monoclonal antibody 4D4. Coordinates and structure factors of the crystal structures of the GM-CSF:F1 Fab and the GM-CSF:4D4 Fab complexes have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank under the accession numbers 6BFQ and 6BFS, respectively. The structures show that these antibodies bind to mutually exclusive epitopes on GM-CSF; however, both prevent the cytokine from interacting with its alpha receptor subunit and hence prevent receptor activation. Importantly, identification of the F1 epitope together with functional analyses highlighted modifications to GM-CSF that would abolish auto-antibody recognition whilst retaining GM-CSF function. These results provide a framework for developing novel GM-CSF molecules for PAP treatment and for optimizing current anti-GM-CSF antibodies for use in treating inflammatory disorders.
3) Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) can occur as a late manifestation of breast cancer and has traditionally been diagnosed by CSF cytology; however, cytology suffers from low sensitivity and it is believed that many cases of LM go undiagnosed. Some studies have suggested the use of CA 15-3 in CSF (CA 15-3 CSF) to aid in the detection of LM. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of CA 15-3 CSF to cytology for the detection and treatment monitoring of breast cancer LM.
4) Multivalent tetanus and diphtheria toxoid containing vaccines belong to the most frequently applied vaccines. However, there is an imbalance in the degree of protection against the two antigens with insufficient long-term protection against diphtheria, particularly in the elderly population. We have previously reported a positive correlation between granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and the production of diphtheria-specific antibodies. Therefore, in the present study we analyzed the effects of in vivo applied recombinant GM-CSF on immunization with multivalent tetanus/diphtheria vaccine in mice of different age. In vivo application of GM-CSF lead to enhanced production of diphtheria-specific antibodies as well as more diphtheria-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells following vaccination with multivalent tetanus/diphtheria vaccine. In contrast, the humoral and cellular immune response to the tetanus component was unaltered. Furthermore, application of GM-CSF resulted in more splenic CD11b<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DCs) with a higher MHC-II expression. GM-CSF also induced a stronger recruitment of CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs to the injected muscle. Most remarkably, GM-CSF was able to boost the diphtheria-specific immune response to the multivalent vaccine in aged mice. This study demonstrates that local administration of GM-CSF is able to improve immune responsiveness to the diphtheria component of multivalent tetanus/diphtheria vaccine in young and old mice. This information could be useful for the future design of vaccines for the elderly.
5) To investigate the association between chronic subsyndromal symptoms of depression (SSD), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and neuropsychological performance in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
6) We measured ceftriaxone pharmacokinetics in patients' plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and assessed the influence of biometric, demographic, genetic (ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCB11, ABCG2, and SLCO1A2 polymorphisms) and pathological features. Adult patients with signs and symptoms of central nervous system infections, receiving intravenous ceftriaxone, were enrolled. Ceftriaxone plasma and CSF concentrations were measured by high-precision liquid chromatographic methods; allelic discrimination was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Forty-three patients were included: median ceftriaxone maximal concentration was 15,713 ng/mL in plasma and 3512 ng/mL in CSF with a CSF-to-plasma ratio of 0.3. ABCC2 1249 rs2273697 (P = .027) and ABCG2 1194+928 rs13120400 (P = .015) variants were significantly associated with CSF concentrations and CSF-to-plasma ratios. At linear regression analysis, CSF-to-serum albumin ratio was an independent predictor of ceftriaxone CSF concentrations (P = .001; also in those with intact blood-brain barrier: P = .031) and CSF-to-plasma ratio (P = .001; also in those with blood-brain barrier impairment: P = .040). We here report the role of transporters' genetic variants as well as of blood-brain barrier permeability in predicting ceftriaxone exposure in the central nervous system.
7) Two cytokines, fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3-L) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are considered to be the essential regulators of dendritic cell (DC) development <i>in vivo</i>. However, the combined effect of Flt3-L and GM-CSF on human DCs has not been evaluated <i>in vivo</i>. In this study, we, therefore, aimed at evaluating this using a humanized mouse model. Humanized non-obese diabetic/SCID/Jak3<sup>null</sup> (hNOJ) mice were constructed by transplanting hematopoietic stem cells from human umbilical cord blood into newborn NOJ mice, and <i>in vivo</i> transfection (IVT) was performed by hydrodynamic injection-mediated gene delivery using plasmids encoding human Flt3-L and GM-CSF. Following IVT, Flt3-L and GM-CSF were successfully induced in hNOJ mice. At 10 days post-IVT, we found, in the spleen, that treatment with both Flt3-L and GM-CSF enhanced the reconstitution of two myeloid DC subsets, CD14<sup>-</sup>CD1c<sup>+</sup> conventional DCs (cDCs) and CD14<sup>-</sup>CD141<sup>+</sup> cDCs, in addition to CD14<sup>+</sup> monocyte-like cells expressing CD1c and/or CD141. GM-CSF alone had less effect on the reconstitution of these myeloid cell populations. By contrast, none of the cytokine treatments enhanced CD123<sup>+</sup> plasmacytoid DC (pDC) reconstitution. Regardless of the reconstitution levels, three cell populations (CD1c<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells, CD141<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells, and pDCs) could be matured by treatment with cytokines, in terms of upregulation of CD40, CD80, CD86, and CD184/CXCR4 and downregulation of CD195/CCR5. In particular, GM-CSF contributed to upregulation of CD80 in all these cell populations. Interestingly, we further observed that Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells within splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly increased in the presence of GM-CSF. Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells could be subdivided into two subpopulations, CD45RA<sup>-</sup>Foxp3<sup>hi</sup> and CD45RA<sup>-</sup>Foxp3<sup>lo</sup> T cells. Whereas CD45RA<sup>-</sup>Foxp3<sup>hi</sup> T cells were increased only after treatment with GM-CSF alone, CD45RA<sup>-</sup>Foxp3<sup>lo</sup> T cells were increased only after treatment with both Flt3-L and GM-CSF. Treatment with Flt3-L alone had no effect on the number of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells. The correlation analysis demonstrated that the development of these Foxp3<sup>+</sup> subpopulations was associated with the maturation status of DC(-like) cells. Taken together, this study provides a platform for studying the <i>in vivo</i> effect of Flt3-L and GM-CSF on human DCs and regulatory T cells.
8) The genetic analysis of the lupus-prone NZM2410 mouse has identified a suppressor locus, <i>Sle2c2</i>, which confers resistance to spontaneous lupus in combination with NZM2410 susceptibility loci, or in the chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) induced model of lupus in the B6.<i>Sle2c2</i> congenic strain. The candidate gene for <i>Sle2c2</i>, the <i>Csf3r</i> gene encoding the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSF-R/CD114), was validated when cGVHD was restored in B6.<i>Sle2c2</i> mice after treatment with G-CSF. The goal of the project reported herein was to investigate the myeloid cells that confer resistance to cGVHD and to ascertain if the mechanism behind their suppression involves the G-CSF pathway. We showed that despite expressing the highest levels of G-CSF-R, neutrophils play only a modest role in the autoimmune activation induced by cGVHD. We also found reduced expression levels of G-CSF-R on the surface of dendritic cells (DCs) and a differential distribution of DC subsets in response to cGVHD in B6.<i>Sle2c2</i> versus B6 mice. The CD8α<sup>+</sup> DC subset, known for its tolerogenic phenotype, was expanded upon induction of cGVHD in B6.<i>Sle2c2</i> mice. In addition, the deficiency of CD8α<sup>+</sup> DC subset enhanced the severity of cGVHD in B6.<i>Batf3</i><sup>-/-</sup> and B6<i>.Sle2c2</i> mice, confirming their role in suppression of cGVHD. B6.<i>Sle2c2</i>DCs presented lowered activation and antigen presentation abilities and expressed lower levels of genes associated with DC activation and maturation. Exposure to exogenous G-CSF reversed the majority of these phenotypes, suggesting that tolerogenic DCs maintained through a defective G-CSF-R pathway mediated the resistance to cGVHD in B6.<i>Sle2c2</i> mice.
9) Post-traumatic CSF leaks are a complication in 2% of all head injuries. Majority of these patients will recover spontaneously. Whilst recent literature has predominantly centred on CSF leaks and their general investigations and management thereof, there is a paucity of information when it comes to those patients who have persistent post-traumatic CSF leaks, as well as the complication of recurrent meningitis. We present a patient with a persistent post-traumatic CSF leak who presented with recurrent bacterial meningitis thirteen times- the highest documented amount in an adult. We reviewed the literature with regards to the above as well.
10) Idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (IBGC), also called Fahr's disease or recently primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), is characterized by abnormal deposits of minerals including calcium mainly and phosphate in the brain. Mutations in SLC20A2 (IBGC1 (merged with former IBGC2 and IBGC3)), which encodes PiT-2, a phosphate transporter, is the major cause of IBGC. Recently, Slc20a2-KO mice have been showed to have elevated levels of inorganic phosphorus (Pi) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); however, CSF Pi levels in patients with IBGC have not been fully examined.
11) The level of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) increases in some disorders such as vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. We previously reported that in Alzheimer's disease patients, a high level of GM-CSF in the brain parenchyma downregulated expression of ZO-1, a blood-brain barrier tight junction protein, and facilitated the infiltration of peripheral monocytes across the blood-brain barrier. However, the molecular mechanism underlying regulation of ZO-1 expression by GM-CSF is unclear. Herein, we found that the erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor ERG cooperated with the proto-oncogene protein c-MYC in regulation of ZO-1 transcription in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). The ERG expression was suppressed by miR-96 which was increased by GM-CSF through the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Inhibition of miR-96 prevented ZO-1 down-regulation induced by GM-CSF both in vitro and in vivo. Our results revealed the mechanism of ZO-1 expression reduced by GM-CSF, and provided a potential target, miR-96, which could block ZO-1 down-regulation caused by GM-CSF in BMECs.
12) PEG-rhG-CSF reduces neutropenia and improves chemotherapy safety. In China's registration trial (CFDA: 2006L01305), we assessed its efficacy and safety against rhG-CSF, and prospectively explored its value over multiple cycles of chemotherapy.
13) Macrophages play a central role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and fibrotic lung diseases. However, alveolar macrophages (AM) are poorly available in humans to perform in vitro studies due to a limited access to broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL). In this study, to identify the best alternative in vitro model for human AM, we compared the phenotype of AM obtained from BAL of patients suffering from three lung diseases (lung cancers, sarcoidosis and Systemic Sclerosis (SSc)-associated interstitial lung disease) to human blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) differentiated with M-CSF or GM-CSF. The expression of eight membrane markers was evaluated by flow cytometry. Globally, AM phenotype was closer to GM-CSF MDMs. However, the expression levels of CD163, CD169, CD204, CD64 and CD36 were significantly higher in SSc-ILD than in lung cancers. Considering the expression of CD204 and CD36, the phenotype of SSc-AM was closer to MDMs, from healthy donors or SSc patients, differentiated by M-CSF rather than GM-CSF. The comparative secretion of IL-6 by SSc-MDMs and SSc-AM is concordant with these phenotypic considerations. Altogether, these results support the M-CSF MDM model as a relevant in vitro alternative to simulate AM in fibrotic disorders such as SSc.
14) Flow suppression techniques have been developed for intracranial (IC) vessel wall imaging (VWI) and optimized using simulations; however, simulation results may not translate in vivo.
15) OBJECTIVE The anterior transpetrosal approach (ATPA) was established in 1984 and has been particularly effective for petroclival tumors. Although some complications associated with this approach, such as venous hemorrhage in the temporal lobe and nervous disturbances, have been resolved over the years, the incidence rate of CSF leaks has not greatly improved. In this study, some varieties of air cell tracts that are strongly related to CSF leaks are demonstrated. In addition, other pre- and postoperative risk factors for CSF leakage after ATPA are discussed. METHODS Preoperative and postoperative target imaging of the temporal bone was performed in a total of 117 patients who underwent ATPA, and various surgery-related parameters were analyzed. RESULTS The existence of air cells at the petrous apex, as well as fluid collection in the mastoid antrum detected by a postoperative CT scan, were possible risk factors for CSF leakage. Tracts that directly connected to the antrum from the squamous part of the temporal bone and petrous apex, rather than through numerous air cells, were significantly related to CSF leak and were defined as "direct tract." All patients with a refractory CSF leak possessed "unusual tracts" that connected to the attic, tympanic cavity, or eustachian tube, rather than through the mastoid antrum. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative assessment of petrous pneumatization types is necessary to prevent CSF leaks. Direct and unusual tracts are particularly strong risk factors for CSF leaks.
16) Ovarian cancer is one of the most common female malignancies, and cisplatin-based chemotherapy is routinely used in locally advanced ovarian cancer patients. Acquired or de novo cisplatin resistance remains the barrier to patient survival, and the mechanisms of cisplatin resistance are still not well understood. In the current study, we found that colony-stimulating-factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) was upregulated in cisplatin-resistant SK-OV-3 and CaoV-3 cells. Colony-stimulating-factor-1 receptor knockdown suppressed proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant SK-OV-3 and CaoV-3 cells. However, CSF-1R overexpression had inverse effects. While parental SK-OV-3 and CaoV-3 cells were more resistant to cisplatin after CSF-1R overexpression, CSF-1R knockdown in SK-OV-3 and CaoV-3 cells promoted cisplatin sensitivity. Overexpression and knockdown studies also showed that CSF-1R significantly promoted active AKT and ERK1/2 signalling pathways in cisplatin-resistant cells. Furthermore, a combination of cisplatin and CSF-1R inhibitor effectively inhibited tumour growth in xenografts. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence that CSF-1R inhibition can sensitize cisplatin-refractory ovarian cancer cells. This study may help to increase understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance in tumours.
17) Late-life depression (LLD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are the two most frequent neuropsychiatric disorders affecting elderly. LLD and AD may clinically present with depressive and cognitive symptoms. Therefore, when cognitive decline is coupled with depression in the elderly, the differential diagnosis between LLD and AD could be challenging. The aim of the present study was to evaluate in a population of elderly patients affected by depression and dementia the usefulness of CSF AD biomarkers (tau proteins and β-amyloid<sub>42</sub>-Aβ<sub>42</sub>) and 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (18FFDG-PET) in early differentiating LLD from AD. Two hundred and fifty-six depressed and demented patients, after performing CSF AD biomarkers and 18FFDG-PET, were distributed in two groups on the basis of the current diagnostic guidelines for AD (<i>n</i> = 201) and LLD (<i>n</i> = 55). Patients were then observed for 2 years to verify the early diagnosis. After the 2 year follow-up we compared AD and LLD patients' CSF and 18FFDG-PET data obtained at baseline to a group of age- and sex-matched controls. We found CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> levels significantly higher in LLD compared to AD patients. Remarkably, CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> levels of LLD patients (range between 550 and 1204 pg/mL) did not overlap with those of AD patients (range between 82 and 528 pg/mL). Moreover, we documented no differences in CSF AD biomarkers (Aβ<sub>42</sub> and tau proteins) when comparing LLD patients to controls. In addition, AD patients showed the significant reduction of 18FFDG-PET uptake in temporo-parietal regions compared to both controls and LLD. Conversely, LLD and control groups did not differ at 18FFDG-PET analysis, although LLD patients showed heterogeneous patterns of glucose hypometabolism involving cortical and subcortical brain areas. It is noteworthy that at the end of the clinical follow-up, patients owing to AD group showed the expected significant decline of cognitive performances, whereas patients assigned to LLD group improved cognition as depressive symptoms recovered. Hence, in case of co-existence of cognitive impairment and depression in the elderly, we propose CSF AD biomarkers analysis to early differentiate LLD from AD and properly target the patient's therapeutic strategy and clinical follow-up.
18) Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) regulates both malignant cells and microenvironmental cells. Its splicing isoforms show functional heterogeneity. However, their roles on leukemia have not been well established. Here, the expression of total M-CSF in patients with hematopoietic malignancies was analyzed. The roles of M-CSF isoforms on the progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were studied by establishing MLL-AF9-induced mouse AML models with high level membrane-bound M-CSF (mM-CSF) or soluble M-CSF (sM-CSF). Total M-CSF was highly expressed in myeloid leukemia patients. Furthermore, mM-CSF but not sM-CSF prolonged the survival of leukemia mice. While sM-CSF was more potent to promote proliferation and self-renew, mM-CSF was more potent to promote differentiation. Moreover, isoforms had different effects on leukemia-associated macrophages (LAMs) though they both increase monocytes/macrophages by growth-promoting and recruitment effects. In addition, mM-CSF promoted specific phagocytosis of leukemia cells by LAMs. RNA-seq analysis revealed that mM-CSF enhanced phagocytosis-associated genes and activated oxidative phosphorylation and metabolism pathway. These results highlight heterogeneous effects of M-CSF isoforms on AML progression and the mechanisms of mM-CSF, that is, intrinsically promoting AML cell differentiation and extrinsically enhancing infiltration of macrophages and phagocytosis by macrophages, which may provide potential clues for clinical diagnosis and therapy.
19) Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein (PTHrP) is involved in intracellular calcium (Ca) regulation, and has been demonstrated to participate in regulation of Ca in brain cells, activation of neurons, and modulation of pain. However, there are conflicting reports regarding the presence of PTHrP in CSF.
20) The purpose of this study is to assess temporal trends in the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis and risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) among older women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer.
