1) To investigate the prevalence and clinical features of posttransplant CNS symptoms in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis and their Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET imaging correlates.
2) Amyloidosis is a group of conditions characterized by the accumulation of amyloid deposits in various tissues. Among these disorders, ATTR amyloidosis occurs either with or without a TTR pathogenic variant. Treatment for amyloidosis depends on the subtype, which is often identified through a tissue biopsy followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Genetic testing may be done to confirm these results for patients with ATTR amyloidosis; however, the necessity of genetic testing after LC-MS/MS has not been evaluated. A retrospective review identified 153 patients diagnosed with biopsy-proven ATTR amyloidosis, and 56 of these patients underwent both genetic testing and LC-MS/MS. LC-MS/MS and proteomics correctly reported the mutant peptide and heterozygosity in 47/56 (84%) cases. It failed to identify two individuals who were homozygous for the ATTRV122I mutation and failed to detect the following mutations in six other individuals: ATTRA19D, ATTRF44L, ATTRT60A, ATTRI68L and ATTRV122I. Therefore, LC-MS/MS is not sufficient to rule out a pathogenic mutation in cases of ATTR amyloid, and genetic testing should be performed in most cases of ATTR amyloidosis. Correct recognition of hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is important for estimating prognosis, proper familial counselling and guiding use of therapies, such as liver transplantation.
3) Transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is a life-threatening, gain-of-toxic-function disease characterised by extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils composed of transthyretin (TTR). TTR protein destabilised by TTR gene mutation is prone to dissociate from its native tetramer to monomer, and to then misfold and aggregate into amyloid fibrils, resulting in autosomal dominant hereditary amyloidosis, including familial amyloid polyneuropathy, familial amyloid cardiomyopathy and familial leptomeningeal amyloidosis. Analogous misfolding of wild-type TTR results in senile systemic amyloidosis, now termed wild-type ATTR amyloidosis, characterised by acquired amyloid disease in the elderly. With the availability of genetic, biochemical and immunohistochemical diagnostic tests, patients with ATTR amyloidosis have been found in many nations; however, misdiagnosis is still common and considerable time is required before correct diagnosis in many cases. The current standard first-line treatment for hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is liver transplantation, which allows suppression of the main source of variant TTR. However, large numbers of patients are not suitable transplant candidates. Recently, the clinical effects of TTR tetramer stabilisers, diflunisal and tafamidis, were demonstrated in randomised clinical trials, and tafamidis has been approved for treatment of hereditary ATTR amyloidosis in European countries and in Japan. Moreover, antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNAs for suppression of variant and wild-type TTR synthesis are promising therapeutic approaches to ameliorate ATTR amyloidosis and are currently in phase III clinical trials. These newly developed therapies are expected to be effective for not only hereditary ATTR amyloidosis but also wild-type ATTR amyloidosis. 
4) Abstract The clinical phenotype of familial ATTR amyloidosis depends to some extent on the particular mutation, but differences exist also within mutations. We have previously described that two types of amyloid fibril compositions exist among Swedish ATTRV30M amyloidosis patients, one consisting of a mixture of intact and fragmented ATTR (type A) and one consisting of mainly intact ATTR (type B). The fibril types are correlated to phenotypic differences. Patients with ATTR fragments have a late onset and develop cardiomyopathy, while patients without fragments have an early onset and less myocardial involvement. The present study aimed to determine whether this correlation between fibril type and phenotype is valid for familial ATTR amyloidosis in general. Cardiac or adipose tissues from 63 patients carrying 29 different TTR non-V30M mutations as well as 13 Japanese ATTRV30M patients were examined. Fibril type was determined by western blotting and compared to the patients' age of onset and degree of cardiomyopathy. All ATTR non-V30M patients had a fibril composition with ATTR fragments, except two ATTRY114C patients. No clear conclusions could be drawn about a phenotype to fibril type correlation among ATTR non-V30M patients. In contrast, Japanese ATTRV30M patients showed a similar correlation as previously described for Swedish ATTRV30M patients. This study shows that a fibril composition with fragmented ATTR is very common in ATTR amyloidosis, and suggests that fibrils composed of only full-length ATTR is an exception found only in a subset of patients.
5) We report a new transthyretin (ATTR) gene c.272C>G mutation and variant protein, p.Leu32Val, in a kindred of Bolivian origin with a rapid progressive peripheral neuropathy and cardiomyopathy. Three individuals from a kindred with peripheral nerve and cardiac amyloidosis were examined. Analysis of the TTR gene was performed by Sanger direct sequencing. Neuropathologic examination was obtained on the index patient with mass spectrometry study of the ATTR deposition. Direct DNA sequence analysis of exons 2, 3, and 4 of the TTR gene demonstrated a c.272 C>G mutation in exon 2 (p.L32V). Sural nerve biopsy revealed massive amyloid deposition in the perineurium, endoneurium and vasa nervorum. Mass spectrometric analyses of ATTR immunoprecipitated from nerve biopsy showed the presence of both wild-type and variant proteins. The observed mass results for the wild-type and variant proteins were consistent with the predicted values calculated from the genetic analysis data. The ATTR L32V is associated with a severe course. This has implications for treatment of affected individuals and counseling of family members.
6) This study investigated whether a relationship exists between the presence of de novo antibodies and the clinical manifestations of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP).
7) A recent 2-year randomized controlled trial indicated that the transthyretin (TTR) tetramer stabilizer, diflunisal, inhibits polyneuropathy progression and preserves quality of life in hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. However, its long-term outcomes are unknown. Here, we report tolerance and efficacy of long-term diflunisal administration in hereditary ATTR amyloidosis.
8) Cardiac amyloidosis is an important cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. Bone scintigraphy with [Tc]hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (Tc-HDP) and [F]sodium fluoride (F-NaF) have been investigated in the noninvasive diagnosis of transthyretin (ATTR)-related cardiac amyloidosis. We present a case of a 76-year-old man with metastatic prostate cancer who underwent Tc-HDP bone scintigraphy with an incidental finding of diffuse left ventricular abnormal uptake suggesting ATTR cardiac amyloidosis. Review of previous imaging showed a negative F-NaF PET/CT study. This example suggests that the mechanism of uptake of Tc-HDP and F-NaF may differ in patients with ATTR cardiac amyloidosis.
9) Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is usually characterised by a progressive peripheral and autonomic neuropathy often with associated cardiac failure and is due to dominantly inherited transthyretin mutations causing accelerated amyloid deposition. The UK population is unique in that the majority of patients have the T60A missense mutation in ATTR where tyrosine is replaced by adenine at position 60. This has been traced to a single founder mutation from north-west Ireland. The neuropathy phenotype is less well described than the cardiac manifestations in this group.
10) Systemic wild-type ATTR (ATTRwt) amyloidosis is a prevalent aging-related disorder. However, a limited number of systemic ATTRwt amyloidosis patients have been diagnosed antemortem, and therefore, the prevalence of ATTRwt is underestimated. Here, we investigated clinical findings of a series of systemic ATTRwt amyloidosis patients with antemortem diagnosis.
11) The disease course and early signs specific to ATTR Ala97Ser, the most common endemic mutation in Taiwan, have not been well described. Since new medications can slow down the rate of disease progression, the early diagnosis of this heterogeneous and fatal disease becomes critical.
12) Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR amyloidosis) is a rare, clinically heterogeneous disease due to heritable mutations that lead to misfolding of a precursor protein and multisystem disease. This study sought to define the clinical characteristics, distribution of mutations and phenotypic presentation of patients presenting to our center with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis.
13) Hereditary transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis (ATTR) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by extracellular deposits of amyloid fibrils composed of misfolded TTR. The differences in penetrance and age at onset are vast, both between and within populations, with a generally late onset for Swedish carriers. In a recent study the entire TTR gene including the 3' UTR in Swedish, French and Japanese ATTR patients was sequenced. The study disclosed a SNP in the V30M TTR 3' UTR of the Swedish ATTR population that was not present in either the French or the Japanese populations (rs62093482-C>T). This SNP could create a new binding site for miRNA, which would increase degradation of the mutated TTR's mRNA thus decrease variant TTR formation and thereby delay the onset of the disease. The aim of the present study was to disclose differences in allele specific TTR expression among Swedish V30M patients, and to see if selected miRNA had any effect upon the expression.
14) We present a case of acute pyelonephritis with right hydronephrosis in a middle-aged woman, who had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren's syndrome. She had successfully treated with antibiotics, however, ureteral stenosis sustained. She underwent ureteroscopy and stenting of right ureter. Biopsy specimen revealed submucosal amyloid deposition in the interstitium overlying a benign urothelium. Amyloid protein was positive for transthyretin (TTR) by immunohistochemistry and amyloid deposition was not demonstrated in other organs. The patient's TTR genes were wild type and she was diagnosed with wild-type ATTR (ATTR wt) amyloidosis. This is the first report about symptomatic ATTR wt amyloidosis, which was also called 'systemic senile amyloidosis (SSA)' in the ureter. We should aware that SSA can occur at younger age and cause symptomatic ureteral stenosis. Further investigation is needed to clarify the association of autoimmune diseases to develop ATTR wt amyloidosis. 
15) It has been reported that subjects of African descent present with heart failure at a younger age and because of different causes than whites. We present contemporary data from UK Afro-Caribbean patients in London.
16) In Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), tissue deposition of transthyretin fibrils translates into a significant subversion of the tissues proteome. We used multidimensional protein identification technology for profiling the proteome of subcutaneous adipose tissue in patients with ATTR, in comparison with controls and patients with other types of amyloidoses, to identify the global proteomic changes related specifically with this disease. The adipose tissue proteome of five ATTR patients and 11 non-affected controls was analyzed. Samples from patients with Light Chain (AL) or reactive (AA) amyloidosis were studied alongside. In all ATTR samples, mass spectrometry data showed that transthyretin was specifically up-represented, being a marker of the nature of the deposits. Tissue resident proteins, involved in key biological processes, were also found to be differently represented compared to controls. The high-throughput analysis of the proteome of amyloid affected fat, combined with bioinformatic data interpretation, is a powerful tool for identification of perturbed protein expression in ATTR amyloidosis.
17) Cardiac amyloidosis had been considered to be an incurable disease; however, new disease-modifying therapeutic approaches have succeeded in ameliorating the disease. Therefore, early and precise diagnosis based on the amyloid precursor protein is extremely important.
18) The carpal tunnel ligament often encloses transthyretin-derived (ATTR) amyloid deposits. In this study we tested the hypothesis that ATTR amyloid in the carpal tunnel ligament is most commonly of wildtype origin in a Caucasian population without endemic background of familial amyloid polyneuropathy. All resection specimens from the carpal tunnel ligament were retrieved from the Amyloid Registry of the University of Kiel spanning the period of 2004-2011 and dichotomized into two study groups: the first study group of 25 patients was obtained from diverse referring pathologists. The second group comprised a patient cohort of 73 patients obtained from a single-referring department of pathology. The selection of biopsies was based on the histological identification of amyloid by Congo red staining and polarization microscopy between crossed polars and immunohistochemical classification as ATTR amyloid. A novel anti-TTR-peptide antibody was raised in rabbits using a recombinant peptide (FHEHAEVVFTANDSGPRRYT) spanning residues 87-106 of the TTR protein. Amplification of the TTR exons 1, 2, 3 and 4 was done by a nested polymerase chain reaction approach. Ninety-eight biopsies were available from 98 patients, including 51 women and 47 men. All amyloid deposits showed strong immunoreactions with the novel anti-TTR peptide antibody. In 81 of 98 patients, genomic DNA was available. In 10 (12%) patients non-amyloidogenic TTR gene mutations were found with the following amino acid substitutions: p.G6S (normal allelic variant). A single patient carried a p.G6S and a p.M13I-variant. The remaining patients all showed wildtype sequence of the TTR gene (70 patients). No significant difference was found between the two study groups. ATTR amyloid in the carpal tunnel ligament is commonly of wildtype origin and genetic counseling is not mandatory in these patients.
19) In order to elucidate the pathomechanism of ocular amyloid formation in a liver-transplanted patient with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis, we investigated detailed biochemical features of ocular amyloid. The patient was a 49-year-old woman with V30M transthyretin (TTR) variant (p.TTRV50M), who underwent ophthalmectomy due to corneal rupture 10 years after liver transplantation (LT). The amyloid was selectively isolated from several portions in intra- and extraocular tissues using a laser microdissection (LMD) system and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to determine the composition percentage of wild-type and variant TTR in the isolated amyloid. Biochemical analysis revealed that the amyloid consisted mainly of variant TTR in intraocular tissues with a percentage > 80%. On the contrary in the extraocular muscles, wild-type TTR was the main component of the amyloid with a percentage of ∼70%. Our data indicate that intraocular amyloid formation strongly depends on locally synthesized variant TTR and the contribution of wild-type TTR to amyloid formation is quite limited.
20) Prealbumin is a maker of nutritional status and inflammation of potential prognostic value in acute heart failure (HF). The aim of this study is to evaluate if low prealbumin levels on admission predict mortality and readmissions in patients with acute HF.
